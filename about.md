I specialize in building secure and performant systems at the intersection of systems programming and infrastructure automation, grounded in due diligence and methodical analysis. My work focuses on creating robust software architectures that can withstand both operational complexity and adversarial conditions.

Engineering is a philosophy of life. It is a way of thinking that extends beyond code; it is how one approaches problems, makes decisions, and understands the world. Good engineering requires understanding systems at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously - and being an eternal learner.

Through writing, I explore the intersection of philosophy and technology. Every system tells a story about the trade-offs its designers were willing to accept and the historical conditions in which it was conceived. Understanding these narratives is crucial to building better technology - and a better future.
